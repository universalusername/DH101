Hello, DH — this site will document my critical making this semester.

## Forest-themed site preview 🌲
A small forest-themed static viewer has been added in the `site/` folder. It provides a photoreal background with beams of sunlight, a dark green/brown palette, and a sidebar to navigate the repository's markdown files. Serve the `site/` folder with a static server (e.g., `python -m http.server`) or publish to GitHub Pages to view it in your browser.
